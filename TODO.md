- [ ] Change "shape" of abstract object to return @IsCallable(obj) = true if obj has [[Call]] internal property (and not Top(Bool))
    - Motivation:
        - function calls throw TypeError exception (try-catch handled imprecisely)
        - IsCallable checks in models handled imprecisely
- [ ] Heap cloning
    - Motivation: Callsite Sensitivity analyzes each function call seperately based on its callsite but objects created at a specific line number in function code are still represented by the same abstract object
- [ ] Model setImmediate(f) (like setTimeout(f,0))
    - Motivation: Delay Promise.prototype.then from executing handlers
    - Idea: Implement an internal API call @DelayedCall that first executes the AfterCall instruction
- [ ] Safe CLI: Parse string directly as JS code
    - Motivation: Easier to analyze small test programs
- [ ] Fix tests that fail for configuration with increased loop-sensitivity

- [ ] Useful source locations for functions defined in jsmodel files
